# appointment_management_system
An appointment management system is a software used by companies and service providers to streamline their service appointments. By using the system, potential customers can know and choose their preferred appointment times according to the companies and service providers' available time slots. This project does not include a B2C marketplace-like interface for customers to browse different service providers.
